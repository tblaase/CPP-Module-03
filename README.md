## About this Module
The Scope of this Module was to get to know C++ further and come in contact with inheritance for classes:
- ex00: creation of the base class to inherit from
- ex01: inherits from base class and adds new values to the attributes as well as a new function
- ex02: inherits from base class and adds new values to the attributes as well as a new function
- ex03: the diaond problem: inherits some attributes from ex02 and some attributes from ex01 and adds an extra function to show its relation to ex00


All of those exercises are compilable with the `-std=c++98-flag`, since this was a requirement for this project.<br>
All exercises where compiled and tested on `macOS Catalina 10.15.7` and `Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS`.


All exercises can be compiled from the root of the exercise with `make`, `make all` or `make re`.<br>
All exercises have a main function to demonstrate all the abilities of the subject.<br>
After that, run the created executable like `./executable_to_run` (ie. ex00 `./ClapTrap`).<br>
